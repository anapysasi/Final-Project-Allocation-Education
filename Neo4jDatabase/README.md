There are too many nodes in the database. The creation of the relationship between all the nodes of the Database can get to be too heavy. 

For that reason we will upload the different tables used in the study for the following five countries: 

1. Afghanistan
2. Algeria
3. Angola
4. Argentina
5. Armenia

The different tables for the subset of the database is upload in this folder. 

In order to get the nodes once you run the code in Neo4j, you need to click on the three dots on the upper rigth corner of the Database (in the Neo4j Deskop App) and click on `Manage`. Then, click on the down arrow of `Open Folder` and then click on `Import`. Copy all the csv to this Folder.

Once you have all the tables on the `Import` Folder, you can run the code from the document `AllocationEducationGraphDatabase.txt` to get the Graph Database.
